# CGD-Survival-Analysis

### Motivation
Our primary interest is to see whether patients treated with interferon gamma have fewer infections than patients treated with a placebo. 

###  Background of CGD 
Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a disorder that impairs white blood cells by mutating its protein structure which inhibits its ability to attack harmful bacteria. CGD often shows up as reoccurring infections in the form of swellings, fevers, and diarhea as a result of damaged white blood cells inability to control inflammation. Treatments include antibiotics, stimulants, and bone marrow transplants. Future treatments are looking into gene therapy that looks to repair that CGD mutations that result in that loss of protein structures leading to immunodeficiency. 

**Interferon Gamma treatment** is an injection of cytokine proteins that look to stop the spread of pathogens by interfering with their replication process, hence the name **interferon**. Healthy white blood cells will release interferons naturally if pathogens are detected cells, however, this ability is inhibited by CGD. Clinicians will often inject interferon gamma in immunocompromised patients to reduce their severity of serious infections. 

### What is Survival Analysis?
Survival analysis is used to analyze data in which **time to the event** is the focus of interest where the response variable is either event time or survival time. The original purpose has its morbid roots in the medical field where clinicians were interested in predicting the survival probabilities of patients with a particular disease based on their individual features/covariates. Domains outside the clinical field have applied survival analysis to problems such as customer churn prediction, bank loan survival, credit risk, etc.
